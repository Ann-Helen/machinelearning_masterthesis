# machinelearning_masterthesis
This is a WIP. My master thesis investigates the relevance of economic macro-indicators in machine learning stock market prediction. The development has started with a simple one-step univariate CNN model and the goal is a multi-headed multi-step CNN model which will be compared to a multivariate multi-step CNN model.
